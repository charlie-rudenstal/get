# get

Retrieve and pipe data from the web with this CLI.  
This project is not ready for use unless you intend to hack on it.

Goals:
- Simple to use
- Small and maintanable code base
- Small, maintanable and easy-to-write plugins to add support for new services
- Avoid unnecessary states and perform all operations asynchronously with lazy execution 

Example:

    $ get tickets from agilezen and order by priority

- `get` is the name of the executable
- `agilezen` is the plugin
- `tickets` is an action on agilezen
- `order by` is a general action provided by get
- `priority` is an attribute of the result
- `from` and `and` are unknowns and therefore ignored

Another example: (the two below are equal)

     $ get ticket number 4 from agilezen + trello | find tickets with title on jira 
     $ get agilezen + trello ticket 4 | jira find title 

Which will find find tickets on jira with titles that match any of the titles from the two tickets with ticketnumber 4 on agilezen and trello
