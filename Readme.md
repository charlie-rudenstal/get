# get

Retrieve and pipe data from the web with this CLI.

Goals:
- Simple to use
- Small and maintanable code base
- Small and maintanable plugins to add new services
- Avoid unnecessary states and perform all operations asynchronously with lazy execution 

Example:

    $ get tickets from agilezen and order by id

- `get` is the name of the executable
- `agilezen` is the plugin
- `tickets` is an action on agilezen
- `order` by is a general action provided by get
- `id` is an attribute in the result
- `from` and `and` are unknown and therefore ignored

This project is not ready for use unless you intend to hack on it.
